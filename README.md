# Visualising Uncertainty

Website: [https://numbat-tutorials.github.io/tutorial_visualising_uncertainity/](https://numbat-tutorials.github.io/tutorial_visualising_uncertainity/)

From exploring variability in a dataset to communicating the distribution of estimates, 
uncertainty visualisation plays a role at every stage of data analysis. 
This tutorial provides an overview of uncertainty, examines how it is represented in R, 
and introduces a range of techniques for visualising it. The first session will introduce 
the concept of uncertainty and cover general visualisation approaches. The second session 
will focus on spatial data and the creative methods that emerge when uncertainty 
must be expressed using only a limited set of visual aesthetics. Wherever there are 
statistics and data, there is uncertainty, making the ability to visualise it effectively 
an essential skill for any statistician.


**Presenters**:

[Dianne Cook](https://www.dicook.org), a Professor of 
Statistics at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, is a global leader
in data visualisation. She has delivered over 100 invited talks 
internationally and published extensively on various aspects of data 
visualisation. Dr. Cook is a Fellow of the American Statistical 
Association, an elected member of the International Statistical 
Institute, past editor of the Journal of Computational and Graphical 
Statistics, and the R Journal. She has served as a Board Member of the 
R Foundation and is currently the co-chair of the Statistical Computing 
and Visualisation Section of the [Statistical Society of Australia](https://www.statsoc.org.au).

[Harriet Mason](https://harrietmason.netlify.app/) is a final year PhD student. She is 
researching how uncertainty can be effectively communicated through statistical graphics, 
particularly in contexts where misleading interpretations must be actively avoided. 
She is the author of several R packages, including `cassowaryr` and `ggdibbler`.

**Background**: You should have a basic understanding of R to the level of working after reading 
[R4DS](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) and working knowledge of making plots with 
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org). Good background reading includes 
[Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/) and 
[Data Visualization: A practical introduction](https://socviz.co).

## Structure of tutorial

### Session 1 Introduction to incorporate uncertainty into data visualisations

This session will focus on introducing common ways of representing uncertainty in data plots, why it is important, and ways to assess new approaches.

| **Topic**               | **Description**                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Introduction**        | What is uncertainty? What is the goal for visualisation |
| **Representation**      | Common approaches for including representation of uncertainty in data plots: show the data, error bars, estimates, models |
| **Perception**          | Aspects of representation that affect perception |
| **Variety**             | Uncertainty representation in different types of plots: univariation and bivariate distributions, time series, spatial data |
| **Testing**             | Testing designs in relation to perceptions |

### Session 2: Incorporating uncertainty into spatial data visualisations

This session will focus specifically on uncertainty visualisation for spatial data. 
In spatial contexts, both the x and y axes are often already used, 
leaving less room for visualising uncertainty through conventional means. 
This session explores these challenges and introduces tools and techniques designed 
to incorporate uncertainty when visualisation options are limited.

| **Topic**                                                                | **Description**                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stuff**                                    | Stuff |
| **Stuff**                                        | Stuff    |
| **Stuff**                                                         | Stuff          |
| **Stuff** | Stuff |
