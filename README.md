[Dianne Cook](https://www.dicook.org), a Professor of 
Statistics at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, is a global leader
in data visualisation. She has delivered over 100 invited talks 
internationally and published extensively on various aspects of data 
visualisation. Dr. Cook is a Fellow of the American Statistical 
Association, an elected member of the International Statistical 
Institute, past editor of the Journal of Computational and Graphical 
Statistics, and the R Journal. She has served as a Board Member of the
