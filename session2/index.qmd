# Topic 1 - Unique challenges of visualising map data

- Why such a focus on spatial visualisations?

Spatial case is a good example to work through because the aesthetics we have to express estimates are limited-
- Variables that areâ€¦
    - Fixed = 
        - position
        - size
        - shape
    - Variables (all kind of change the same thing)
        - colour / fill
        - alpha (transparency) - indistinguishble from changing the colour value tbh
- Not uncommon for maps to warp the fixed elements, or get creative and add stuff 
    - hex plots
    - cartogram
    - grid layout
    - glyph maps


# Topic 2: Hands-on spatial example -  getting data with quantified uncertainty

- General structure of spatial data and basic data cleaning 
- Sources of uncertainty in spatial cases
    - e.g. data summarised for a specific region
    - also have usual stuff like estimated values from a spatial model.
- Methods to arrive at quantified uncertainty
    - Bootstrapping
    - Theoretical distribution (assumed normal?)


## Topic 3: Methods for visualising uncertainty in maps 

Go through some popular packages. Show what format the data needs to be in. Show how to make plots using this data format. 

Different packages require different input and cleaning processes
- Vizumap: distribution as a q function
- ggdibbler: distribution from distributional
- biscale: estimate and standard error as two variables

Spatial cases
- Choropleth map
    - ggplot2
- Bivar & VSUP
    - kind of made up with no obvious way to align results with hypothesis testing
    - 2D palette
    - vizumap, biscale, ggdibbler
- Pixel maps
    - ggdibbler and vizumap methods
- Glyph maps
    - vizumap
