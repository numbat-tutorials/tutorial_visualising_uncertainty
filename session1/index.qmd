# Introduction

- bag plot
- model only (regression, wages example) vs adding data
- ggdist
- tidyindex

## Topic 2:  Common measures and representations

*I have sometimes had a bit of confusion about when to plot uncertainty vs original when talking to people, so I added a slide for the in useR talk that mentioned when you have a situation where you need to do an uncertainty visualisation rather than just showing the data. It seemed to make it a bit clearer for the audience. The slide basically said:*
- Original data can show
    - small sample sizes, high variability, missing values, other failled assumptions
- However, original data is not always…
    - Available
        - anonymised data, data is combined from multiple sources,  theoretical values, etc
    - Relevant
        - Sampling distribution, distribution of model parameters, etc
    - Determnistic
        - data with measurement error, bounded data, etc


## Topic 3:  How this affects perception
*notes taken from useR talk slides*
Why can’t we just treat uncertainty as another variable?
* Uncertainty is not just another variable…
    * It presents an interesting perceptual problem
    * Two sides of the same coin
* Usually do not want variables to interfere with each other
    * In uncertainty visualisation, the opposite is true
    * This is the core of the signal suppression approach we implement

## Topic 4:  Uncertainty representation in different types of problems
*from the ggdibbler notes the conditional line plot. All the examples are from time series packages, because I spent a bit of time looking for the one that returned a distributional forecast so I could use it in an example*
Common ways we express uncertainty in R and when you would see them out in the wild?
- Distributional (vectorised distributions that are wrappers on the d, p, q, r functions) 
    - e.g. when you get it as output - fable, some Bayes stuff (e.g. posterior)
- Base R (d, p, q, r functions)
- Confidence intervals
    - hi low variables in the forecast packages
- Bootstrapping (?)


## Topic 5: Deciding which is the best design
*notes taken from useR talk slides*
Evaluation criteria - Uncertainty visualisation should…
1. Reinforce justified signals
2. Hide signals that are just noise
Similar logic to a hypothesis test (but not as binary, and without set thing you are checking for)

*notes taken from useR talk slides*
Accessibility considerations
- Colour
    - 2D palette is harder to read as colour is not a simple 3D space. Mapping a variable to saturation hurts accessibility.
(Maybe specifically mention this in section 2?. I am not sure of other accessibility issues other than colour issues (and maybe size?).
